A simple library for Automatic Differentiation in ```C++```. 

## Work in progress...
## Note to me: Sort variables wrt ids's in operators. This may help you simplify things. 
## Note to me:  Define Sum and Product for many variables (e.g. `Sum<expr, restExpr...>`) recursively, but with expressions ordered in some way.
